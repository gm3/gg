## 🏗️ Architecture & Modularity

### JSON-Based Configuration
The entire system is now **fully modular** and loads from a **single JSON file**:

- **`public/config.json`**: Contains everything - stat types, quests, defaults, storage keys, and app name

This means you can:
- Create entirely new skill trees by editing one file
- Change stat types, quests, and configuration all in one place
- Reuse the entire system in other projects with different data
- Perfect for AI-generated skill trees - just provide the config file!
- No code changes needed to customize the skill tree!

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── main.js                    # Entry point - loads config & quests from JSON
├── data/
│   └── loadData.js           # JSON loader with caching and error handling
├── state/
│   └── progressStore.js      # Modular state management (initialized from config)
├── components/
│   ├── SkillTree.js          # Main orchestrator component
│   ├── SkillMap.js           # SVG tree renderer (accepts quests as param)
│   ├── ListView.js           # Mobile list view (accepts quests as param)
│   ├── CharacterStats.js     # Stats display (uses dynamic stat types)
│   ├── NodeModal.js          # Quest detail modal
│   ├── ProgressStepper.js    # Progress visualization component
│   └── SettingsMenu.js       # Hamburger menu with actions
└── styles/
    └── main.css              # Comprehensive styling with responsive breakpoints
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gg
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd skill-tree-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   npm run dev
   
   # Or from skill-tree-app directory
   cd skill-tree-app
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   - The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite assigns)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the repo root `docs/` folder (configured for GitHub Pages).

## 📝 Customization Guide

### Creating a Custom Skill Tree

Everything is configured in a **single JSON file**: `skill-tree-app/public/config.json`

```json
{
  "appName": "Your Skill Tree Name",
  "statTypes": {
    "strength": "Strength",
    "wisdom": "Wisdom",
    "charisma": "Charisma",
    "intelligence": "Intelligence"
  },
  "defaultStats": {
    "strength": 0,
    "wisdom": 0,
    "charisma": 0,
    "intelligence": 0
  },
  "storageKey": "your_skill_tree_progress",
  "quests": [
    {
      "id": "unique_quest_id",
      "tier": 1,
      "category": "Category Name",
      "title": "Quest Title",
      "description": "Quest description text",
      "emoji": "🎯",
      "points": {
        "strength": 2,
        "wisdom": 1,
        "charisma": 1,
        "intelligence": 0
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**That's it!** Just edit one file and the entire skill tree adapts. Perfect for AI-generated skill trees or quick customization.

**Key Points:**
- All quests go in the `quests` array
- Stat types in `points` must match keys in `statTypes`
- `defaultStats` should have all stat types initialized to 0
- `tier` can be any number (typically 1-3, but flexible)
- `category` is for organization (used in list view)

### Using in Other Projects

1. Copy the `skill-tree-app` folder
2. Update `public/config.json` with your stat types **and** quests
3. Customize styling in `src/styles/main.css` if needed
4. The system will work with any stat types and quest structure, entirely driven by that one config file!
